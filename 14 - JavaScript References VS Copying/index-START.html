    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    // console.log(age, age2);
    
    age = 200
    // console.log(age, age2);

    let name = "Dan";
    let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);

    name = "Fisk"
    // console.log(name, name2);
    
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players;
    
    // console.log(team);
    // console.log(players);
    
    // team[3] = "Terry"
    // console.log(team);
    // console.log(players);


    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // const team2 = players.splice();
    // console.log('Players before -', players);
    // console.log('Team 2 before -', team2);

    // players[3] = "Terry"
    // console.log('Players after -', players);
    // console.log('Team 2 after -', team2);



    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // const team2 = [...players]


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // console.log('Players before -', players);
    // console.log('Team 2 before -', team2);

    // players[3] = "Terry"
    // console.log('Players after -', players);
    // console.log('Team 2 after -', team2);


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      possessions: {
        cars: 2,
        phones: 1,
        cats: 3
      } 

    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;

    // person2.age = 25;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person);

    const person4 = Object.assign({}, person, {legs: 2, age: 17}); // Adding or altering properties

    person3.age = 25;

    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    
    // Looks like its working!!
    const person5 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
